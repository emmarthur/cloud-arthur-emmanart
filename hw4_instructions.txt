1. Setup
Within your course repository, create a directory "hw4". Commit and push to your remote repository.

cd <path_to_repo>
mkdir hw4
touch hw4/Dockerfile
touch hw4/app.py
touch hw4/url.txt
git add hw4
git commit -m "initial commit for hw4"
git push

2. Assignment
For this homework, you will:

Adapt your application from prior homeworks to use a Cloud Datastore backend. Note that you will need to use a different "Kind" in your model_datastore.py file so as to not conflict with the data from the Guestbook labs.
Construct a Dockerfile for containerizing it
Deploy the containerized version of your application on Cloud Run using the name "hw4" and leave it up for grading (i.e. gcloud run deploy hw4 --image ... )
Place the URL for your Cloud Run deployment in url.txt. URL will have the form of https://hw4-....run.app.
Throughout the development process, you will need to commit and push your code to your git repository.


3. Rubric
