                    SCREENCAST WALKTHROUGH STEPS
================================================================================

STEP 1: Checking out the application source code from your course repository.

STEP 2: Describing steps one would need to take to run your project 
        (e.g. setting up the Google Cloud services, service accounts, and 
        credentials required, setting up the APIs you have integrated, and 
        setting up any software packages needed).

STEP 3: Building and deploying the container within your Google Cloud project. 
        Pause the screencast to wait for deployment in order to shorten the 
        length of the screencast.

STEP 4: Demo the client agent by stepping through all of the functionality 
        it supports.

STEP 5: Perform a source code walk-through using your repository via the 
        MCECS Gitlab website that explains how each feature has been implemented.

STEP 6: Walk-through the git commit history showing the diffs of each commit 
        via the MCECS Gitlab website while describing the timeline of your 
        incremental development process for the project. There must be at least 
        one commit per individual MCP tool you have implemented. Ensure you 
        click through the commits showing the Python code added for implementing 
        individual features.

STEP 7: To ensure you are the one completing the screencast, your screencast 
        MUST initially include a video of you narrating the walkthrough. It is 
        recommended for you to record your screencast as a recorded screen share 
        on Zoom. Note that, when logged into Zoom, recordings are automatically 
        captured and uploaded to PSU's Media Space and can be accessed after a 
        short time by visiting "My Media" within Media Space.
