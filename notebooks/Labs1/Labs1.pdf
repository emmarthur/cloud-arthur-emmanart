ip address of remote host: 131.252.208.103/24
hardware address of remote host: 52:54:00:13:a0:c6
ip address of default router(0.0.0.0/0): 131.252.208.1
default router hardware address: 00:00:5e:00:01:01
default router name: router.seas.pdx.edu
number of entries in the ARP table: 24
ip addresses that have the same hardware address: 
mirrors.cat.pdx.edu (131.252.208.20) at 52:54:00:5f:45:5f [ether] on enp1s0
simirror.cat.pdx.edu (131.252.208.121) at 52:54:00:5f:45:5f [ether] on enp1s0
how many less hardware addresses are there than IP addresses in the ARP table? : 3
command for getting all ip address from arp table and putting them in the arp_entries file: arp -an | awk -F ' ' '{print $2}' > arp_entries
network prefix that most ip address in arp_entries file use: 131.252.208 
vm ip address: 10.138.0.2
vm hardware address: 42:01:0a:8a:00:02
default router's ip address for vm: 10.138.0.1
default router's hardware address for vm: 42:01:0a:8a:00:0

How many subnetworks are created initially on the default network? How many regions does this correspond to?: The number of subnetworks is 43 and the number of regions it corresponds to is 43
Given the CIDR prefix associated with each subnetwork, how many hosts does each subnetwork support? Each subnetwork in the list is /20 so it would be 2**32 - 2**20
Regional instances used: europe-north1-a and asia-east1-a
Which CIDR subnetworks are these instances brought up in? Do they correspond to the appropriate region based on the prior commands? : Each instance lines up with the /20 subnet for each region
From the figure in the previous step. What facilitates this connectivity: the virtual switch or the VPN Gateway? it is a virtual switch both the source and destination IPs are internal IPs that belong to the same default VPC network (10.0.0.0/8 range).
